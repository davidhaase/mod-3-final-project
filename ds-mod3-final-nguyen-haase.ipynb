    "Typically, when you are writing something that's technical, you want a headline that's appealing. This will help you to reach a wider audience and let your work have more visibility and impact as well. The headline or topics of your tutorial should include a short title (typically 10~15 maximum words). The title can include the technology and technique you are talking about, combined with a nice action verb that appeals to a wider audience. For instance, I titled one of my articles as follows: \"Building RNNs is Fun with PyTorch and Google Colab\". You can get pretty creative with the headline, but keep in mind that this is the face of your article and it should be given plenty of tinkering before you finalize it.\n",

    "## Project Description\n",
    "The project description marks the beginning of the tutorial you are writing. It should be clear, concise, and interesting. Here I suggest you to briefly explain what the following notebook tutorial does (usually one sentence)? Then you can explain what technologies you will be using in the tutorial (usually one sentence)? You can also briefly explain what value or knowledge the user will obtain after finishing the tutorial (a short list or two sentences will do)? In addition, you can give credit to any of the notable resources you are utilizing, and also briefly introduce yourself if the project description is not too lengthy?\n",

Besides visually describing the dataset in use to your audience, also try to briefly explain (in one or two sentences) where the data came from, i.e., the source of the data. Other specifications like dimensions and attribute type are important but can be neatly explained with examples using code and tools such as pandas."

It should clarify any confusion that can present itself during the modeling section of the tutorial. Remember, your audience wants to get a broad understanding of the data before the modeling component of the tutorial, so try to explain this part of the tutorial as clear as possible with examples. Take advantage of your notebook features and other tools such as matplotlib and pandas."

    "## [Testing Model]\n",
    "One of the things I have learned over the years is that everything in data science is better understood with examples, rather than just using plain code or pictures. Before you begin training your models make sure to explain to the reader what the model is expecting as input and what it is expected to output. Rendering code here with nice descriptions help to prepare the reader on what to expect during training the model, especially since the training code is usually longer than most sections of the tutorial. With libraries like PyTorch and DyNet this is fairly easy since they are dynamic computing libraries. TensorFlow also offers an eager execution command, tf.enable_eager_execution() to evaluate operations immediately. This is what's called imperative programming and I am glad they have it. It makes it easy to teach others about the beautiful things these tools are able to accomplish. I like to think that data science is about storytelling and discovery, and it should remain that way. Clear writing helps!\n"

    "## [Training Model]\n",
    "When training the models you would specify what kind of optimization, hyperparameters, and data iterating methods you are using. To be honest, the training code is usually self-explanatory. If you did your job at the beginning, explaining your dataset and testing the model, this part of the tutorial is probably the one that needs less explanation. In my experience, most data computing libraries use similar training strategies, thus the training structure has become ubiquitous in some sense. If there is still any clarification in your training that you need the reader to know, you can always explain it beforehand."

It also helps to re-emphasize on the values the tutorial is providing for the reader. This part of the tutorial also helps to finalize your final thoughts and share insights with your readers. Readers love insights. You can share plots, a lot of examples, and even explore the parameters of the model."
